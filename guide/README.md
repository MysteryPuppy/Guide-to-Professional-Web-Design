# Introduction

This Guide will cover the basics of professional web design and help show how to code for others and not just for yourself. In university, it can be easy to not care about how the code *looks* as long as it *works* but this is not the case in business where code needs to be maintained over long periods of time by many different people. It's entirely possible that colors and font styles could change and if the website is poorly structured this could be extremely time-consuming. This guide will help correct poor coding habits as well as possibly teach you something entirely new!

Before starting the tutorial, I wanted to talk a bit about my background so you know where I started and where I am today. I am a third year computer science major studying at Cardiff University in Wales. Originally I was focusing on data analytics but that has since changed to user interface design. In the summer of 2019 I had an internship in Japan at a company called justInCase where I was working on their website. Upon arrival, I thought I knew a good amount about HTML and CSS—I mean, it's usually considered simple, right?—but there is a lot that universities don't teach when it comes to sustainable and neat looking code. Honestly it was a little embarrassing how messy my code was but it was also an amazing learning opportunity. There's no better way to learn than to have your code checked by a professional and I shall now impart that wisdom onto you.

 I am not a professional. I am a college student who wants to share some tips, rules, and guidelines that you can use to have a leg-up when you do enter the workforce.

## Assumptions

This guide assumes basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. You don't need to be a master but it's good if you understand how to make a basic website already. If you already know how to use GitHub, BitBucket, etc. then skip to the [Styling Conventions & Coding]() section.

 That being said, let's get started!
