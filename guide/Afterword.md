# Afterword

Well it seems you have made it to the end. Hopefully this guide has taught you one or two things and in the best case it taught you many.

Eventhough there are lots of rules and it may seem a bit overwhelming to memorize them all at first, know that the more you make websites and actually *utalize* these rules, the easier it becomes to do without even thinking about it. Everyone messes up sometimes and the best you can do is just understand that it is a learning experience and not give up. Sometimes rules have to be broken in very specific circumstances and that is OK as long as you realize that a rule is being broken and what to be weary of because of that. In the end, these rules are not going to make you a professional by themselves, but they will make your work look more like something a professional would produce.

Keep learning and thanks for stopping by!
