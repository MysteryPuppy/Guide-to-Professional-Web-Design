In the summer of 2019 I had an internship in Japan at a company called justInCase where I was working on their website. Upon arrival I thought I knew a good amount about HTML and CSS—I mean, it's usually considered simple, right?—but there is a lot that universities don't teach when it comes to sustainable and neat looking code. Honestly it was a little embarrassing how messy my code was but it was also an amazing learning opportunity.
